- 👋 Hi, I’m @catsagainst. My name is Mariia. 
- 👀 I’m interested in software testing (of course also I'm interested in Bach's "Goldberg Variations", Thomas Mann books, bossa nova, Eduard Manet etc but it's another story)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the instrument which could be useful for testing. And Python. It's so elegant.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a project on Software Testing. Manual testing. Where I could use Charles, Postman, SQL queries, DevTools etc.
